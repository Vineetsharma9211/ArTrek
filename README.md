## Description
ArTrek is a user friendly mobile and web application that allows users to search a specific art term to return a set of results.
The results will allow the user to identify a given artefact from the Europeana database with a Google Map location, which will allow them to navigate to the museum or collection where the artefact is stored. 

The application is built using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. HTML elements are dynamically displayed using for loops and information gathered from a thrid party API. 

This application is ideal for those researching specific areas of art history and require location information on specific areas of reasearch.

## Usage
Users navigate through the search bar. Results are dynamically displayed through the website in cards which contain information on the given artefact alongside a Google Map Location, allowing users to gather a wealth of information on their search results.
